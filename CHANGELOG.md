## [1.1]
- Removed ```chameleon.time``` option
- The time is automatically calulated whenever you have set the
    ```chameleon.latitude``` and ```chameleon.longitude``` options.
- You can now override the automatically calculated hours by setting
    ```chameleon.day``` or ```chameleon.night``` to your preferred hours
    (e.g. have day hour be at sunrise and night hour be at 17 or any other hour)
